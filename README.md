# Cmpecraft_Game_in_Prolog
This project was my 1st Homework for the course CMPE 260 (Principles of Programming Languages) at Bogazici University. It was my first project on logical programming paradigm.
## About the Project
This project was about implementing necessary predicates for a given Minecraft-like game 'Cmpecraft'. The mechanisms are already given, so my task was to complete all the given predicates. Detailed information about the game and the predicates can be found in the description file. This was my first project on a logical programming language and it was a challanging task. But after learning the basics of Prolog, I easily finished the given code.
## To Run the Code
One should install SWI-Prolog in order to execute the given code. After installing you can simply run the code:

```prolog main.pro```

Note: The files 'constants.pro', 'cmpecraft.pro', and the regarding map file should be in the same directory with the 'main.pro'.

You can try different scenerios with given two different maps, or you can even change the objects in the map to examine the predicates further.
